Patch 0.1.0 - 19_03_2024

First "official" patch notes

Additions
- Proper Ruleset implementation
    - Users can now select a provided ruleset upon creation of a session
    - Provided rulesets are based on what I think are the most common rulesets
    - Rulesets 2 through 5 restrict how many pokemon can be caught per route and what pokemon can be used for fusions
        - Rulesets are explained below
        - A future patch will add proper descriptions somewhere on the site, likely when creating a session
    - Ruleset 1 is a "Full Freedom" ruleset that allows for manual linking, unlinking, no restrictions on fusions (except for fusions of already fused pokemon)
        - Please select this ruleset upon session creation if your personal ruleset that you like to play with does not line up with any of the already provided ones
    - A future update will narrow-down which pokemon are able to be fused during the fusing process to streamline the process even further.

    - Complications - Spare Pokemon
        - I know a popular ruleset is to allow spare pokemon to be caught especially when using a ruleset similar to 3 or 4. 
        - I don't currently have a good way to implement this but would like to implement a way to do this in the future.

Rulesets
Rulesets are implemented to give more quality of life and ease of use to anyone using the tool. For example a popular rule for a Soul-Link Nuzlocke is to only allow each player to 
capture 2 pokemon per route. These pokemon are then fused together and soul-linked to the fusion of the other players' two pokemon for that same route. So the tool will only allow the user 
to fuse pokemon together that meet this criteria. Pokemon are also not soul-linked upon capture and tied to the route instead unlike in a couple other rulesets.

1 - Full Freedom
    - Players can catch any amount of pokemon per route
    - Pokemon are not linked upon capture
    - User is able to manually link/unlink pokemon at their discretion
    - Route tracking is not enabled as players can track any amount of pokemon per route as they wish.
2 - Auto-Link One Catch per Route
    - Players can only catch one pokemon per route
    - Pokemon entered at the same time will automatically become soul-linked
    - Because base pokemon are soul-linked fusions must also contain soul-linked base pokemon. Head/Body order does not matter 
    - Manual link/unlink is disabled
3 - Auto-Link catches and Fusions two per route
    - Players can only catch two pokemon per route
    - Pokemon entered at the same time will automatically become soul-linked
    - Because base pokemon are soul-linked fusions must also contain soul-linked base pokemon. Head/Body order does not matter 
    - Manual link/unlink is disabled
4 - Route-Link
    - Players can only catch two pokemon per route
    - Pokemon entered at the same time will be linked to the route selected
    - Fusions can only occur if both the body and the head are from the same route 
    - Fusions are soul-linked based on the base pokemon routes
        - e.g. Player 1 fuses both pokemon caught in route 1 and that fusion is linked to Player 2's fused pokemon whose head and body are pokemon also caught in route 1.
    - Manual link/unlink is disabled
5 - Special ruleset
    - This is the ruleset that I like to use as it allows for players more choice on their own fusions.
    - Players can only catch two pokemon per route
    - Pokemon are linked to the route they were caught in
    - Fusion may occur as long as the combination of each players routes match up
    - For example:
        Player 1 catches Bulbasaur and Player 2 catches Chikorita in Route 1
        Player 1 catches Charmander and Player 2 catches Cyndaquil in Route 1
        Player 1 catches Squirtle and Player 2 catches Totodile in Route 2
        Valid Fusion:
            Player 1 fuses Bulbasaur and Squirtle together, Player 2 fuses Chikorita and Totodile together
            Reason - Both Bulbasaur and Chikorita were caught in Route 1, and both Squirtle and Totodile were caught in Route 2 so the combination for both players is Route 1 and Route 2
        Another Valid Fusion:
            Player 1 fuses Bulbasaur and Squirtle together, Player 2 fuses Cyndaquil and Totodile together
            Reason - Both Squirtle and Totodile were caught in Route 2 and ...
            ... even though Bulbasaur was Players 1's first catch in route 1 and Cyndaquil was Players 2's second catch in route 1, ...
            ... they were both still caught in Route 1 meaning the combination of each players routes is 1 and 2 and therefore a valid fusion
        Invalid Fusion:
            Player 1 tries to fuse Bulbasaur and Charmander together, Player 2 tries to fuse Cyndaquil and Totodile together
            Reason - Bulbasaur and Cyndaquil were both caught in Route 1, however Player 2 tries to fuse a pokemon caught in Route 1 with a pokemon caught in Route 2 ...
                    so Player 1's route combination is 1 and 1, while Player 2's route combination is 1 and 2 
            Compromise - If Player 2 insists on using a fusion of Cyndaquil and Totodile together then Player 1 must include a pokemon caught in Route 1 and 2 in the fusion, ...
                    ... therefore Player 1's fusion must at least contain Squirtle, however the other pokemon for the fusion can be either Bulbasaur or Cyndaquil
